                            <p>The student and I worked together on creating and sorting an array of strings in JavaScript. We created an array containing both lowercase and uppercase letters. The student lacked a clear understanding of callback functions and how sorting is expressed in code. With much guidance, he was able to implement a case-insensitive sort using .sort() with a supplied callback.</p>
                            <p>The second part of the assignment involved creating a function to represent the logic of .indexOf() in a traditional for loop. The student initially struggled with structuring the loop and the return conditions but, with a short lecture, he successfully wrote the loop. In addition, we were able to wrap the loop in a function that took in the array and a search value as parameters.</p>

                            <p>The student was able to grasp how separating out functions allowed for him to reuse code and to store/maintain the chords. However, much more study and practice is needed for a more foundational understanding of functions and arrays. I advised him to meet with his professor to gather further study materials for this type of assignment.</p>

                            <p>The student and I worked to convert a JavaScript array of song metadata into an HTML page. Initially, the student had a partial understanding of how to access the array elements and had written some correct code to create and append elements using DOM manipulation. However, there were several issues with the structure and logic of the code that needed to be corrected.</p>
                            <p>We reviewed the use of createElement and appendChild to dynamically build the HTML structure for each song. We focused on creating elements for the album artwork and song details and appending them correctly to the document. The student had some elements displaying correctly, but many parts were not functioning as intended.</p>
                            <p>Through guided problem-solving and debugging, the student managed to correct these issues and display the data as required. We ensured the function could handle any number of songs by iteration. Finally, we discussed how to use CSS to style the elements for a given song.</p>
                            <p>Overall, the student gained a better understanding of dynamically creating and appending HTML elements using JavaScript, improved his troubleshooting and debugging skills, and learned how to correct his initial mistakes to achieve the desired outcome.</p>
