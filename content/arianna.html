    <h4><strong>Tutoring Summary for Arianna C. (Nov 2020 - May 2021)</strong></h4>

        <div class="col">
            <p>During my time as a tutor for Arianna, I played a significant role in helping her navigate the complex curriculum of the Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program at a popular online university. Throughout our sessions, I ensured that complex topics were broken down into manageable segments, enabling Arianna, who came from a non-IT background, to achieve excellent grades in her coursework.</p>
            <p>The program allowed students to pair their coursework with a specific industry focus - in this case, healthcare technology, which is an industry she is interested in and happens to be my career background. We were able to approach assignments with hospital-related scenarios, making the learning experience slightly “hands on”.</p>
            <p>As this was my first serious volunteer tutoring engagement, I was unaware of the importance of recording each session's topic, goals, and outcomes, as I have done in more recent efforts. As a result of this lack of data capture, <u>the following summary represents my core tutoring areas and supplemental lecture work over the course of more than 6 months:</u></p>
